🚀 **Machine Learning for Symptom-Based Disease Prediction**  
---
## 📜 Overview  
A Machine Learning-based system that predicts diseases from user-provided symptoms, offering:  
- Accurate disease prediction.  
- Timely diagnosis to reduce delays.  
- Specialist recommendations for better care.  
---
## 🛠️ Methodology  
1. **Data Collection**: Symptom-disease data from reliable sources.  
2. **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF for text-to-numerical conversion.  
3. **Model Development**: Using SVM, Random Forest, and Ensemble methods.  
4. **Doctor Recommendation**: Suggests appropriate specialists.
